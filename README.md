# HR Analytics Portfolio-project


ðŸ”¹ **About the Project**

HR analytics in Power BI refers to the use of Power BI, a popular business intelligence and data visualization tool, to analyze and gain insights from human resources (HR) data. With Power BI, HR professionals can connect to various data sources, transform raw HR data into meaningful visualizations, and make data-driven decisions to optimize workforce performance, improve employee satisfaction, and enhance overall HR operations.

ðŸ”¸ **KPIs**

Creating interactive and dynamic HR KPI dashboards allows HR professionals and management to monitor key performance indicators and HR metrics in real-time. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPIs to address the following points:

**Employee Count:** The HR department lacks visibility into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively.

**Attrition Count:** The organization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organization.

**Attrition Rate:** Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.

**Active Employees:** The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.

**Average Age:** The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees, making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and
retain younger talent.


ðŸ”¹ **Building Dashboard**

In this project, we have created an interactive and dynamic dashboards that allows HR professionals and management to explore HR data visually. Dashboards can contain multiple visualizations and filters, enabling users to drill down into specific aspects of HR analytics.
